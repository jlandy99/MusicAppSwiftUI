# Unnamed Music Application (iOS)

This application is designed to allow users to make playlists pulling songs from multiple common music applications (Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, and even Youtube (if premium)). It will work by using APIs/SDKs from each of these providers as well as a sleek user interface to allow users to quickly and easily search for songs, artists, albums, etc. on their app(s) of choice and build a playlist from multiple apps that would've been impossible before!
